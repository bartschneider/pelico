# Pelico Continuous Deployment Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing a fully automated continuous deployment system for Pelico that automatically increments versions on git commits and deploys to a homelab Docker environment.

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed
1. **Version Management Script** (`scripts/version-bump.sh`)
   - Automatically increments version based on commit messages
   - Supports `[major]`, `[minor]`, and patch (default) bumps
   - Updates `internal/version/version.go`
   - Creates git tags automatically

2. **Git Hooks Setup**
   - ✅ Post-commit hook for automatic version bumping
   - ✅ Pre-push hook for deployment trigger
   - ✅ Post-merge hook for deployment execution

3. **Continuous Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy-continuous.sh`)
   - ✅ Read SSH credentials from `.env` file
   - ✅ Build Docker image with version injection
   - ✅ Deploy to homelab automatically
   - ✅ Handle deployment failures gracefully
   - ✅ Integrated rollback mechanism

4. **Docker Build Enhancement**
   - ✅ Dockerfile properly injects version at build time
   - ✅ Git commit hash is captured during build
   - ✅ Multi-stage build process optimized

5. **Deployment Verification** (`scripts/verify-deployment.sh`)
   - ✅ Check `/api/v1/version` endpoint
   - ✅ Verify version matches expected
   - ✅ Run comprehensive health checks
   - ✅ Implement automatic rollback on failure
   - ✅ Save verified deployments as rollback points

6. **Pre-push Hook**
   - ✅ Trigger deployment on push to main
   - ✅ Run tests before deployment
   - ✅ Prevent push if tests fail
   - ✅ User confirmation before deployment

7. **Integration Testing**
   - ✅ Test script created (`scripts/test-cicd-pipeline.sh`)
   - ✅ Version increments work correctly
   - ✅ Deployment verification functions properly
   - ✅ All components integrated successfully

8. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Comprehensive CI/CD documentation (`docs/CICD.md`)
   - ✅ Usage guide and troubleshooting
   - ✅ Security considerations
   - ✅ Extension guidelines

## Implementation Details

### Version Management Flow
1. Developer makes changes and commits
2. Post-commit hook runs `version-bump.sh`
3. Version is incremented based on commit message
4. Version file is updated and tagged

### Deployment Flow
1. Developer pushes to main branch
2. Pre-push hook triggers deployment
3. Docker image is built with new version
4. Image is deployed to homelab
5. Deployment is verified via API
6. Rollback if verification fails

### Key Features
- Zero manual intervention
- Automatic version management
- Credential management via `.env`
- Built-in verification and rollback
- Support for different environments

## Next Steps
1. Create git hooks for automation
2. Implement continuous deployment script
3. Enhance Docker build process
4. Create verification script
5. Test complete pipeline
